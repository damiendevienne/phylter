\usage{
VizualizeGene(trees, gene, distance = "patristic",
bvalue = 0, gene.names = NULL, method.imp = "IPCA",
ncp = 3, center = FALSE, scale = FALSE, maxiter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{A list of gene trees in multiphylo format.}
\item{gene}{The gene to plot.}
\item{distance}{A method to generate distance matrices. It could be "nodal" to establish that the distance between two species is the number of nodes that separate them. Or "patristic" (default) if the distance between two species is be the sum of branch lengths between them.}
\item{bvalue}{This argument is only used if trees contain bootstrap values. It determines under what bootstrap values the nodes should be collapsed. Value 0 (the default) means that no nodes are collapsed.}
\item{gene.names}{List of gene names if the user want to renames the list of trees. NULL by default.}
\item{method.imp}{The method used for missing data imputation. "IPCA" for imputation with iteractive PCA (Slower but more accurate) ."MEAN" for imputation by means (faster but less accurate).}
\item{ncp}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". integer corresponding to the number of components used to to predict the missing entries.}
\item{center}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". boolean. By default FALSE leading to data not centered.}
\item{scale}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". boolean. By default FALSE leading to not a same weight for each variable.}
\item{maxiter}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". integer, maximum number of iteration for the algorithm.}
