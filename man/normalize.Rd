\usage{
normalize(mat, what = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A matrix}

\item{what}{Character string indicating whether the matrix should be
normalized and how. If what="none", the matrix is not normalized (the
default), if what="species", the matrix is normalized so that the difference
between species is increased, and if what="genes", the matrix is normalized
so that the difference between genes is increased. Normalization consists
in dividing each entry by either the mean of each row or the mean of each column.}
}
\value{
A normalized matrix
}
\description{
This function normalizes the 2WR matrix (or any matrix) according to the
species (rows) or to the genes (columns). This normalization is described
