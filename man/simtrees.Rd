\title{Simplistic simulation of gene trees with outliers}
\usage{
simtrees(Ngn, Nsp, Nsp.out = 0, Ngn.out = 0, Nb.cell.outlier = 0, brlen.sd = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ngn}{Number of gene trees to simulate.}

\item{Nsp}{Number of species (tips) per tree.}

\item{Nsp.out}{Number of outlier species (also called rogue taxa). 0 = none.}

\item{Ngn.out}{Number of outlier genes. 0 = none.}

\item{Nb.cell.outlier}{Number of times one species in one tree is misplaced. 0 = none.}

\item{brlen.sd}{Heterogeneity of branch lengths in trees. A value with mean 0 and standard
deviation equal to brlen.sd is added to each branch length.}
}
\value{
A list of trees in \code{multiPhylo} format.
}
\description{
Simple (simplistic) simulation of trees with outliers.
}
\details{
The simulation process is as follows: a first tree is generated with the \code{rtree()} function
and is then duplicated and modified according to the parameters chosen by the user.
}
\examples{
 
# Very basic simulator, for debuggin purpose mainly.
# examples: 30 genes, 120 species, 2 outlier species, 3 outlier genes
# 4 gene/species outliers, branch length variance = 0.6 
trees<-simtrees(30,120,2,3,4,0.6)
